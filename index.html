      <strong> Fleetwood Mac </strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      Fleetwood Mac was a a very popular band in the 70's. They fall into the
      genre of soft rock, with popular songs like Dreams, The Chain, Go Your Own
      Way, and Silver Springs. My personal favorite is Landslide (which is
      actually my favorite song of all time).üíó
